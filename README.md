## Pre-requisites

1. In order to run your Smart UI tests with Selenium Python, you will need to set your LambdaTest username and access key in the environment variables. Click the **Access Key** button at the top-right of the Automation Dashboard to access it.

**Windows**

```js
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
```

**macOS/Linux**

```js
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
```

2. Install `pip` and Python.

```
sudo apt install python-pip
sudo apt install python
```

3. The recommended way to run your tests would be in `virtualenv`. It will isolate the build from other setups you may have running and ensure that the tests run with the specified versions of the modules specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

```
pip install virtualenv
```

## Running Your First Selenium Python Test

1. To get started, clone the `Python-Selenium-Sample` Repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/smartui-python-sample
```

2. Next, create and activate the virtual environment in the `Python-Selenium-Sample` folder.

```
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Inside the `Python-Selenium-Sample` folder, export the `LambdaTest Credentials`. You can get these from your automation dashboard.

**Windows**

```js
set LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
set LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
```

**macOS/Linux**

```js
export LT_USERNAME="YOUR_USERNAME" 
export LT_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR ACCESS KEY"
```

4. To run your first test, run the below given command.
```
python test.py
```
